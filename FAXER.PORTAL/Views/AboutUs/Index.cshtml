                            How it started
                        </h3>
                        <p>Whilst studying in London, MoneyFex founder Dr Louis Anegekuh saw an opportunity to innovate money transfer and international payment services. As the founder of a UK based charity organisation that was doing work in some African countries, the need to send money abroad became paramount. This would often require regular money transfers online or traveling to a money transfer agent who would charge an extortionate premium for small transactions.</p>
                        <p>
                            Although, Dr Anegekuh regularly transferred money abroad for projects, his absence from the continent to manage or control how the money transferred was spent by project managers, resulted in overspending and a lack of proper accountability.
                            He therefore embarked on a journey to try to create an improved money transfer service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This journey involved designing and developing an online solutions that gives organisations like his and people sending money abroad, the ability to control or manage money transferred as remittances.  This control is achieved through a virtual accounting system that allows a money sender to register an account in the name of a potential beneficiary who lives abroad. This virtual account can be credited online from abroad and control usage by the money sender (registrar). A virtual account registered by a money sender comes with a user-friendly dashboard that is instantly accessible to beneficiary (i.e. account user) who in most cases will be living in the money sender’s home country.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In addition to controlling withdrawal from an account, MoneyFex allows money sender to set standing order to ensure that money is always available when needed by the beneficiary.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the sender can determine how much is withdrawn the account by the beneficiary, MoneyFex is helping to reduce overspending on projects and to an extent, improves on accountability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although Dr Anegekuh’s initial journey was to develop a money transfer accounting solutions for organisations such as his, he also saw the need to include an international payment service that allows money senders to directly pay for services such as hospital and utility bills, school fees and accommodation in their home country while abroad.
